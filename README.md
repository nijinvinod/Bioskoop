#Synopsis

<b>Bioskoop</b> embraces on the subject of reviews and people who compose the same. In the content dominated epoch, individuals often are swayed away by reviews that may persuade them to do anything based on the reviews. But very often, these reviews are based on the enthusiasm of one particular person’s taste. In reality, the writer and reader's mindset need to be same. For instance - Envision yourself being a person who is interested in Space Exploration and you would like to know reviews about the movie “Interstellar”. Suppose you happen to read a review given by a person who has very less knowledge about space, and then the information conveyed to you will be wrong.<br/><br/>
Bioskoop, a Watson-based shrewd system which plays an important role in finding out individuals with similar characters and mindset so that the reviews given by these people can have more impact on your lifestyle. Bioskoop can excavate any trending topic in Social Media by taking the large amount of tweets/feeds as input and give a collective opinion by using Watson’s Personality Insights service to compare your character with the person who had given the review. Also, the tweets can be split into positive or negative polarity using Watson’s Sentiment Analysis giving an overview of how reviewers react to a trending topic. Further, you have the feasibility to check tweets from people of same age group or gender.  Bioskoop can be connected to any range of enthusiasm like political opinions, literature inclinations, shopping preferences, apparels likes and so on.
